# Credit_Risk_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to find the best possible algorithm to predict whether giving out a loan is a high-risk or low-risk operation based on a series of metrics for individual users. 

Using Supervised Machine Learning techniques, several models are trained by first declaring which variables are parameters and which are features, then splitting both sets into training and testing variables.
After the training stage, the testing part of the data is used to evaluate the model, after which an accuracy score, a confusion matrix and an imbalanced classification report are generated to validate how effective each algorith is.
